## Getting Started

This project was based in the IntelliJ IDE, as such instructions are based on it.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Note: This project is still in the developement phase. I followed a tutorial on getting started with JavaFX and SQL, and I'm applying my knowledge further to enhance the user experience.


I created the project to easen planning my weekly schedule so I can keep up with Due Dates
