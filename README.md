- Make sure you have Java and JavaFX downloaded, as well as the libraries that we will be using (specified in the lib directory)
- The src folder holds the java files that make up the program
- the out folder and the Planify.iml is generated by IntelliJ when the program is run

## Setting up the Project
If you clone the project most of the project will be already set up but you'll need to have SQL and XAMPP Control Panel.
In the XAMPP Control Panel, you'll need to START the Apache and MySQL modules and click Admin to view the phpMyAdmin which holds the server database.

In IntelliJ:
File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings
  Go to Project, Language Level should be SDK default and choose the most recent SDK (I used Oracle OpenJDK 22.0.1 during production)
  Go to Libraries, add all the files given in the lib folder
  Then Click Apply

Run -> Edit Configurations -> + (Add) -> Application
  Name: Main
  Main CLass: hellofx.PlanManagementSystem
  Run On: Local Machine (unless you'd prefer one of the other options)
  VM Options: --module-path ${PATH_TO_FX} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
  - Note. PATH_TO_FX should be the location of JavaFX (check where you downloaded it)
